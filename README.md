# AI-Agents

Welcome to the LangGraph + AI Agents Playground!  
This repository is intended as a learning and experimentation space for testing, building, and refining autonomous agent workflows using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), and other Python-based tools in the AI ecosystem.

## üöÄ Project Goals

- Learn how to define and manage agent state using Pydantic
- Explore LangGraph for building dynamic multi-agent workflows
- Test different prompt chaining and decision-making strategies
- Experiment with tool calling, memory, and agent coordination
